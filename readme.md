# Span Tests

This project takes advantage of some new features of .netcore 2.1+ and c# 8, like ref struct, non-nullable reference types, spans, etc.

It is a __toy__ project, aiming at playing with those new features, while writing a basic json deserializer. Thus, it should never be used for anything else than fun :)

The conclusion of this project is that _Newtonsoft.Json_ is not replaced yet... :)
